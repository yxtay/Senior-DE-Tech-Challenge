## System Design

You are designing data infrastructure on the cloud for a company whose main business is in processing images.

The company has a web application which allows users to upload images to the cloud using an API. There is also a separate web application which hosts a Kafka stream that uploads images to the same cloud environment. This Kafka stream has to be managed by the company's engineers. 

Code has already been written by the company's software engineers to process the images. This code has to be hosted on the cloud. For archival purposes, the images and its metadata has to be stored in the cloud environment for 7 days, after which it has to be purged from the environment for compliance and privacy. The cloud environment should also host a Business Intelligence resource where the company's analysts can access and perform analytical computation on the data stored.

As a technical lead of the company, you are required to produce a system architecture diagram (Visio, PowerPoint, draw.io) depicting the end-to-end flow of the aforementioned pipeline. You may use any of the cloud providers (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP) to host the environment. The architecture should specifically address the requirements/concerns above. 

In addition, you will need to address several key points brought by stakeholders. These includes:
- Securing access to the environment and its resources as the company expands
- Security of data at rest and in transit
- Scaling to meet user demand while keeping costs low


You will need to ensure that the architecture takes into account the best practices of cloud computing. This includes (non-exhaustive):
- Managability
- Scalability
- Secure
- High Availability
- Elastic
- Fault Tolerant and Disaster Recovery
- Efficient
- Low Latency
- Least Privilege

Do indicate any assumptions you have made regarding the architecture. You are required to provide a detailed explanation on the diagram.
